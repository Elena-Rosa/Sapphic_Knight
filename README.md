## Description

The king has overtaxed the town of main character Sappho, a knight that abandoned their knighthood because of the injustices against others not living to societal normalities. The town is made of others that do not live within societal norms. Different genders, love for others of the same gender, individuals that were born in the wrong gendered body at birth. Because of these aspects the king has heavily taxed the town to where they can not afford to live and eat. The town was not able to afford the last tax payment due, so the king sent in his team of knights and slaughtered their family and friends. The team of knights that killed their town was part of the same team she was on, as a parting nod to their time spent together, they let them keep their life.

The main character then sets off on a journey of revenge to destroy the king and the toxic patriarchy that has destroyed everything they love. While journeying on their quest to take out the king and his knights, the main character meets a fellow lady adventurer that is also on a quest to take down the king. They develop a bond of trust and love for eachother. They encounter 2 monsters/enemies (Please create some that fit with this plot line) that fit with this plot. The third would be the head knight that slaughtered their friends and family, yet let them live. The most painful sentence of punishment.

Once the main character and their companion reach the king, the companion reveals their identity as the princess. Banished by the king as a young child for causing their mothers death.
