Object layers and props
- When working with object layers you place them freely without the tile grid constraint (press Control to snap its position to tile grid before placing it on the map.

- If you want to place props as sprites, use object layer instead. Then you must grab this sprite from a special "tileset"(.tsx).
This special .tsx is a collection of images. If this special .tsx type is not yet provided by me, you can create it yourself. Click
"create tileset" and in the Type combobox bellow the Name field, select "collection of images". Now that you created this
collection of images, select the "+" button in the tool bar on the top and select all sprites (shift+click to select multiple sprites).
While you are still in the .tsx that you created, If you're trying to select these images you gonna notice that the left mouse button doesn't work. Use the
right mouse button instead. You can't select multiple sprites at once too after imported them but you can reimport individual sprites. Select the image and look for
the tileset properties to change it.
It's weird I know XD but it works

- Press T or select "insert tile" in the top tool bar to place the props in the object layer.

- If you just want to place small props that are within the tile unit size (e.g 32x32) and you don't need place them freely, it's preferable that
you use the normal tileset and place these tiles in a tile layer because you have more options to work with tiles since this is the main focus of this software.

- When working with objects, you have the advantage to have an auto z-sort while placing or moving props in the Tiled Editor


Bear in mind that I still recomend to place most sprites directly in your game engine. However, you can still do it in Tiled with no problem.




Auto-tile
-Rules are per layer which means the autotile/automapping only works if you draw in a specific layer. You can open the rule files and see
what layer name is being used for a particular autotile (e.g wall-1). You can also open the example maps to quickly see all the layer names.


Misc
- Tile Stamp
You can select multiple tiles and create a tile stamp. This way you can create custom brushes. If this window is not opened anywhere yet, then
go to view > views and toolbars > Tile Stamps.

-If you're not using any tile from a tileset in you map then you have to open this tileset manualy. Once your map have at least one tile from this tileset, It 
will be opened automatically everytime you open your map. You can also embed the tileset into your map, and it will always be available. However
I'm not sure if this embed tileset will be updated in case you make changes to the .png for instance.

-If the tileset has transparency and you draw the part that is transparent, you can open it in any image editor paint it with 20% opacity color to actually see it while drawing
and then remove it when you finish drawing your map. It's easy and takes a few seconds.

- Press H to highlight the layer you're working on
